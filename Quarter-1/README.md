# AI-101: Fundamentals of AI-Driven and Spec-Driven Development (Quarter 1)

**Book Reference:** [The AI Agent Factory](https://agentfactory.panaversity.org/)  
**GitHub Repository:** [Panaversity](https://github.com/panaversity)  
**Batch Reference:** Batch 82 - AI-101: Fundamentals of AI-Driven and Spec-Driven Development (Batch_82-Q1-CAARE)

## Course Information

**Book Coverage:** Parts 1-4 (Chapters 1-14)  
**Duration:** 13 Weeks  
**Focus and Theme:** Paradigm Shift, Strategic Mindset, AI-Native Environment, Tool Mastery, Prompt Engineering, Context Management, and Spec-Driven Methodologies

## Goal

Forge a "Co-Learning" partnership with AI agents, empowering students to orchestrate intelligent systems. Learners gain mastery over essential tools, development environments, and the core languages of precise prompting, structured context, and reusable specifications for scalable, agentic workflows.

## Quarter Overview

This intensive foundational quarter ignites the paradigm shift from traditional coding to AI-native and spec-driven development, grounding students in the why and how of 2025's $3T developer revolution. Through the nine pillars of AI-Driven Development (AIDD), learners explore economic inflection points, solo-strategy frameworks (e.g., Piggyback Protocol), and the strategic edge of agentic collaboration. Hands-on modules equip setups for AI agents (Claude Code, Gemini CLI), AI-native IDEs (Zed, Cursor), and Git/Bash workflows, while building fluency in Markdown-structured prompts, progressive context loading, and Spec-Driven Development (SDD) for modular, validated intelligence. By quarter's end, students transition from AI consumers to orchestrators, ready to spec and co-build reusable systems with confidence.
