# 🚀 Class Summary: AI Agents for Business Automation (21 Dec 2025)

Today's session marked a major shift from "User Interface" to "User Intent" as we explored the 2026 AI Commercial Playbook. We are moving beyond simple chatbots into the era of Agentic AI—software that doesn't just talk, but acts, reasons, and learns autonomously.

## Key Highlights

### The Three Waves

We've moved from:

- **Predictive AI** (analyzing data)
- **Generative AI** (creating content)
- **Agentic AI** (autonomous action)

### General vs. Custom Agents

**General Agents** (e.g., Claude Code):

- The "Smart Consultants" that live in your terminal
- "God Mode" over your OS to solve novel problems

**Custom Agents** (e.g., OpenAI SDK):

- The "Assembly Line" built for reliability, scale, and specific business workflows
