## 📝 Key Concepts

### Prompt Engineering vs Context Engineering

**Prompt Engineering:**

- Crafting effective prompts to get desired outputs from LLMs
- Focus on input structure and clarity
- Optimizing the initial instruction

**Context Engineering:**

- Managing and structuring context for LLMs
- Token management and memory windows
- Providing optimal context for better responses

### Understanding Tokens

- Tokens are the basic units of text that LLMs process
- Different models have different token limits
- Token count affects cost and response quality

### LLM Working System

- **System Prompt:** Instructions that define the AI's behavior and role
- **Rules:** Constraints and guidelines for the AI's responses
- **Context Window:** The amount of text the model can consider at once

### Claude.md (Project Brain File)

A markdown file that serves as the central knowledge base for your project, containing:

- Project specifications
- Architecture decisions
- Context and background information
- Guidelines for AI agents working on the project

### MCP – Model Context Protocol

- Standard protocol for providing context to AI models
- Enables structured communication between applications and LLMs
- Facilitates better context management

### Claude Subagents

- Specialized agents within Claude Code
- Each subagent has a specific role or expertise
- Can be orchestrated together for complex tasks

### Plan Agent

- An agent that helps break down complex tasks into steps
- Creates structured plans for execution
- Assists in project planning and task decomposition

### Creating Custom Agents in Claude Code CLI

- Learn to build custom agents for specific workflows
- Configure agent behavior and capabilities
- Integrate agents into your development process
