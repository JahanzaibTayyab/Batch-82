# Extract Your Human Job Into Skills

**Posted:** Jan 25, 2026  
**Points:** TBD  
**Due Date:** TBD  
**Status:** ACTIVE

## 🎯 Assignment Objective

Turn what you already do into 3-5 focused, reusable capabilities that replace parts of your own job and could help others with similar work.

This assignment helps you identify and codify your daily work into Agent Skills that can automate repetitive cognitive tasks, save time, and reduce mental load.

## 🚀 Setup

### Step 1: Create Project Folder

1. Create a new folder for this assignment on your computer:
   ```bash
   mkdir assignment-5-skills
   cd assignment-5-skills
   ```

2. **Open the folder in VS Code or Cursor:**
   - **VS Code:** `File → Open Folder` → Select your `assignment-5-skills` folder
   - **Cursor:** `File → Open Folder` → Select your `assignment-5-skills` folder

### Step 2: Initialize Claude in Your Project

1. Open the integrated terminal in VS Code/Cursor (`Terminal → New Terminal`)

2. Start Claude Code in your project:
   ```bash
   claude-code
   ```
   Or if using Claude Code Router:
   ```bash
   ccr code
   ```

3. Verify Claude is working by asking a simple question in the terminal

4. **Important:** All work for this assignment should be done in this project folder using Claude to help you implement the skills

## 📋 ACTIONS

### 01. Describe Your Daily/Weekly Work to Claude Code

**In your project folder with Claude Code running:**

- Use Claude in your terminal (within the `assignment-5-skills` project folder)
- Describe your typical daily or weekly work routine to Claude
- Include all tasks, decisions, analyses, and coordination activities
- Be specific about the types of work you do regularly
- Ask Claude to help you document this in a file (e.g., `my-work-description.md`)

### 02. Identify Repeatable Cognitive Tasks

From your work description, identify tasks that involve:
- **Decisions:** Making choices based on criteria or rules
- **Writing:** Creating content, reports, emails, documentation
- **Analysis:** Reviewing data, comparing options, evaluating outcomes
- **Coordination:** Managing workflows, organizing information, scheduling

Focus on tasks that:
- Happen frequently (daily or weekly)
- Follow similar patterns each time
- Require cognitive effort but could be automated
- Have clear inputs and outputs

### 03. Implement 3-5 Narrow, Measurable Skills

**Using Claude in your project folder, create skills that:**

1. **You actually use** - Solves a real problem in your workflow
2. **Saves time or reduces mental load** - Provides measurable value
3. **Could be reused by someone like you** - Has value beyond your personal use

**For each skill:**
- Work with Claude to create the skill folder structure in your project
- Use Claude to help write the SKILL.md file and any supporting code
- Test each skill with Claude to ensure it works correctly
- Keep all skills organized in your `assignment-5-skills` project folder

Each skill should be:
- **Narrow in scope** - Focused on one specific task
- **Measurable** - You can quantify the time saved or quality improved
- **Reusable** - Others in similar roles could benefit

## ⚠️ CONSTRAINTS

### Skills Must Be Small
- **100-900 lines of code (LOC) is fine**
- Keep skills focused and manageable
- Avoid creating monolithic skills that do too much

### Each Skill Must Have One Clear Outcome
- One skill = one specific result
- Clear success criteria
- Predictable output format

### Each Skill Must Be Measurable
- Define metrics for success
- Track time saved, errors reduced, or quality improved
- Be able to demonstrate the value

## 📦 DELIVERABLES

### ✅ 3-5 Skills (Claude Code / General Agent)

Create 3-5 working skills that:
- Are properly structured as Agent Skills (folders with SKILL.md)
- Can be invoked by Claude Code
- Solve real problems from your daily work
- Are documented and tested

### ✅ README.md Documentation

Create a short README.md describing:
- **What each skill replaces** - The human task it automates
- **Time saved** - Quantify the efficiency gain
- **Quality improved** - How the skill improves outcomes
- **Usage instructions** - How to use each skill

### ✅ Demo Video (60-90 seconds)

Record a screen recording demonstrating:
- How you use each skill in your workflow
- The before/after comparison
- The value it provides

**Recording Tool:** Use [Loom Chrome Extension](https://www.loom.com/) to record easily

## 🔍 Submission Checklist

Before submitting, ensure:

- [ ] Project folder created (`assignment-5-skills`)
- [ ] Project opened in VS Code or Cursor
- [ ] Claude Code running in the project folder
- [ ] Work description documented (e.g., `my-work-description.md`)
- [ ] 3-5 skills created and working in the project folder
- [ ] Each skill has one clear outcome
- [ ] Each skill is measurable (metrics defined)
- [ ] Skills are small (100-900 LOC each)
- [ ] README.md documents what each skill replaces, time saved, and quality improved
- [ ] Demo video (60-90 seconds) recorded and uploaded
- [ ] All skills tested and verified to work

## 💡 Tips for Success

1. **Start Small:** Begin with one skill that solves a clear, frequent problem
2. **Be Specific:** The more specific your skill, the more valuable it will be
3. **Measure Everything:** Track time saved, errors reduced, or quality metrics
4. **Think Reusability:** Consider if someone else in your role would find this useful
5. **Iterate:** Start with a basic version, then refine based on usage

## 📝 Example Skills

Here are examples of skills you might create (adapt to your own work):

- **Email Triage Skill:** Automatically categorizes and prioritizes emails
- **Report Generator Skill:** Creates standardized reports from raw data
- **Code Review Skill:** Analyzes code and suggests improvements
- **Meeting Notes Skill:** Extracts action items and summaries from meeting transcripts
- **Data Analysis Skill:** Performs routine data analysis and visualization
